All code for Machine Learning Randomized Optimization Assignment
Each notebook contains all code for four randomized optimization techniques (random hill climb, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, and MIMIC) applied to the optimization problem. The Neural Network optimization problem is applied to the mushroom dataset that can be downloaded at the following url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom. Download the files and move to the folder you are running the notebooks in, or update the filepaths in the code to point to the new file location.
